This directory is where the font table and Fontmap is stored.

font_table.csv is a small database containing information about the fonts.
It is used by the extrafont package for generating the Fontmap file, and for
registering fonts with R for use with PDFs.

The Fontmap file is used by GhostScript for embedding fonts.
